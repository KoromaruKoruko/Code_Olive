Dependency Functions are functions defined to be outside the Plugin dll that are from another Plugin.
They DO NOT include functions from External Dependencies ONLY ones from other Plugins.

There are currently only 2 forms of dependencies Hard and Soft.

Soft Dependency Functions: these *can* be loaded but if not found will not cause the plugin to *fail*.
Hard Dependency Functions: these MUST be available in order for the plugin to get started otherwise it will be unloaded and *ignored*.
