Currently Version Control only persists of the Game knowing what version the plugin is on, however soon it will be used to version check Dependency Functions, and load the latest version of your plugin.

Your plugin version persists of 3 parts:
  A Major, A Minor and a Build

Major : this is the major build number
Minor : this is the minor build number
Build : this is the type of Plugin Ie Black, White, Alpha, Beta.....

How are versions checked */ going to be checked*

Versions are checked as such
act : actual Plugin Version
trg : Target Plugin Version

(act.Major == trg.Minor &&
  act.Minor >= act.Minor ||
act.Major > trg.Major) &&
    act.Build == trg.Build
    
Note: if a build is not specified it gets given a null value in witch case the above check validates the build correctly.
